# imphead -- impatient head(1)

The imphead utility is an impatient version of the Unix head(1)
utility. It runs a command, shows at most _n_ lines of its output,
then interrupts it.

This is a convenient way to limit searching and filtering commands
when you only need a few matches or a general idea of the results.
Instead of carefully planning just the right query you can rapidly
bash things into imphead until you get what you want.
