IMPHEAD(1)
==========
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----

imphead - show some output from command then kill it

SYNOPSIS
--------

*imphead* [-n _lines_] _command_ [_argument_ ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *imphead* utility is an impatient version of the head(1) utility.
It runs _command_, shows at most -n _lines_ of its output, then
interrupts it. The default is 10 lines.

This is a convenient way to limit searching and filtering commands
when you only need a few matches or a general idea of the results.
Instead of carefully planning just the right query you can rapidly
bash things into *imphead* until you get what you want.

SCRIPTING
---------

The *imphead* utility is not designed for reliable use in shell
scripts.

EXAMPLES
--------

Show some C files in the current directory:

    imphead find . -type f -name "*.c"

Show some files inside a compressed archive:

    imphead tar -tf gcl-2.6.7.tar.gz

Show some C files inside a compressed archive:

    imphead sh -c "tar -tf linux-2.6.28.2.tar.bz2 | grep '\.c$'"

Show the cover page of an internet RFC:

    imphead -n 50 curl -s https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt

Show some uses of an identifier in source code:

    imphead grep -Rin compile-file .
